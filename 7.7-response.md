1. Traditional programming takes an input of data and rules, and gives an output of answers. Machine learning, on the other hand, takes an input of answers and data, and gives an output of rules. In other words, from the given answers and data, it tries to link the two together.
2. The first answer I got was 12.999944, and the second was 12.999991. They are different because there is a limited amount of data to train on. However they are very very close to each other since they are a part of the training data, and therefore whatever pattern (line) is found, most likely fully applies to it as well.
3. The best deal (not including things like remodeling) would be the Hudgins house since its price (per room) is about $137,000 less than predicted. The worst deal would be the house of Church since it is about $100,000 more than predicted.
